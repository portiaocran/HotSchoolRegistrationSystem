# HotSchoolRegistrationSystem
A fully functional Java application with a graphical user interface, following the MVC design pattern that replicates a school registration system. Students can be added to the HotSchool database (SQL) and enrolled in courses. Courses can also be added or removed if no students are enrolled. Users can view which courses a student is enrolled in and which students are enrolled in a course. All data is stored in the HotSchool database.
